Any Questions?

## Prepare for the next session

To prepare for the next session, please read the paper by @vandenabeeleDigitalWellbeingDynamic2021. 

<br><br>

After you have finished reading, try to answer the following questions:

- What is a good definition of digital well-being? How might this be associated
with the concept of *autonomy*?
- Take a look at the table on pp. 941-942. Do you understand what all of the
described factors mean? If not, try to find out and write down what you have
found. If you are still not sure, write this down as well and bring your
questions to the next session.

### Definition of Digital Well-Being

> "Digital wellbeing is a **subjective individual experience** of optimal balance between the benefits and drawbacks obtained from mobile connectivity. This experiential state is comprised of **affective and cognitive appraisals** of the integration of digital connectivity into ordinary life. People achieve digital wellbeing when experiencing maximal **controlled pleasure and functional support**, together with **minimal loss of control and functional impairment.**"

### Literature Review of Digital Autonomy

**Problem:** Very broad construct, very much literature, how to narrow down?

:::fragment
- Citation Chasing?
- Autonomy ["Concept"](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q484105)?
- (Computational) Scoping Review
:::

:::fragment
**Step 1: Gain an overview with the help of Topic Modeling...**
:::

***

**What is Topic Modeling?**

- A corpus consists of $D$ documents und $V$ words (or terms): bag-of-words approach
- Assumption: there are latent clusters of topics $K$ which occur to varying degrees within $D$ and are indicated by specific words $w$ which belong to each $K$ with a specific probability
- Goal is the computation of two matrices: $D*K$ and $V*K$

General Overview [@maierApplyingLDATopic2018, 94]

![](img/02_mcparadox/top_mod.jpg){height=300px}

- $\phi$ = Word-topic assignment matrix
- $\theta$ = Document-topic assignment matrix


## Computational Scoping Review

![Topic model (*k* = 14) with corresponding top words (i.e., highest β probability for topic) and most likely OpenAlex concepts (highest level and probability score). Relative topic prevalence γ over entire corpus (n = 1744). Topic labels in grey boxes based on qualitative assessment.](img/02_mcparadox/tm.png)

## Goals and Research Questions

**Goal 1: Integrating Human Computer Interaction and Communication Research**

- **RQ1**: What are the *mechanisms* that are proposed to connect digital media use and autonomy need experiences?

**Goal 2: Integrating Other Perspectives on Digital Autonomy**

- **RQ2**: Which *research perspectives* can be identified in the study of digital autonomy?
- **RQ3**: What are the *theoretical approaches* that are used by these perspectives and how do they relate to each other?
- **RQ4**: Which of these perspectives focus on *individual perceptions* of digital autonomy or *autonomy need experiences* that relate to digital media use?
- **RQ5**: How are individual perceptions of digital autonomy or autonomy need experiences that relate to digital media use *studied empirically*?

Any Questions?

## Prepare for the next session

To prepare for the next session, please read the paper by @vansteenkisteBasicPsychologicalNeeds2023. 

<br><br>

After you have finished reading, try to answer the following questions:

- How can we define autonomy need experiences?
- How do the key criteria of BPNT described within the chapter relate to digital media use? What might be implications for studying digital autonomy?
- Can you think of examples that are similar to the empirical studies described in the chapter, but relate to digital media use?
- Did you find anything odd while reading the chapter? Can you identify aspects that might be worthy of critique?

## Defining Autonomy Need Experiences

:::fragment
> "**Autonomy** refers to the experience of **volition, willingness, and authenticity** in one’s actions, thoughts, and feelings. Autonomy reflects integrity, as one is 'in unison' with regard to one’s aims and actions. When frustrated, one experiences a sense of **pressure and inner conflict**, thereby feeling pushed in an unwanted direction.
>
> **Relatedness** denotes the experience of warmth, bonding, and care and is satisfied when one feels connected to significant others. Relatedness frustration involves a sense of social alienation, exclusion, and loneliness. **Competence** concerns the experience of effectiveness and mastery. When frustrated, one experiences a sense of failure and helplessness."

<!-- List some arguments in favor or against the propositions of SDT, for example regarding the following (provocative) talking points: -->

<!-- - Autonomy is used to explain behavior that we are not able to explain in other ways; the more we understand about behavior, the less we have a need for the concept of autonomy -->

<!-- - How does Personal Autonomy relate to Moral Autonomy and Relational Autonomy? [see e.g., @arvanitisPhilosophicalPerspectivesAutonomy2023] (<https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/autonomy-moral/>) -->

### Goals of Literature Reviews

based on @baumeisterWritingNarrativeLiterature1997

- Theory development
- Theory evaluation
- Survey the state of knowledge
- Problem identification
- Historical account

:::

***

### Common Mistakes

based on @baumeisterWritingNarrativeLiterature1997

- Inadequate introduction (e.g., lack of theoretical framework)
- Inadequate coverage of evidence (e.g., amount of detail)
- Lack of integration (e.g., lack of "take-home message", how do the studies fit together?)
- Lack of critical appraisal (e.g., methodological weaknesses)
- Failure to adjust conclusions (e.g., ignoring previously mentioned critique)
- Blurring assertion and "proof" (e.g., mixing up ideas and evidence)
- Selective review of evidence (e.g., ignoring studies that don't fit the narrative)
- Focusing on researchers rather than the research (e.g., "XY said that...")
- Stopping at the present (e.g., ignoring implications for future research)

:::

***

### Theoretical Integration

- Do not only describe the procedures and observations of various studies but relate them to the theoretical issues
- **Synthesis**: a summary of individual study findings which juxtaposes them, often to identify patterns and provide a basis for (further) integration
- **Analysis**: methods that critically assess the synthesized evidence, try to explore/explain heterogeneity, and ultimately answer the RQs

***

### Critical Appraisal

- Do not critique individual studies, but groups of studies
- Composite quality scoring (CQS): Uses a pre-validated quality appraisal sheet that captures a composite index of overall study quality (rather uncommon)
- Assessment of best practice:
  - Sampling (e.g., selection, assignment to conditions)
  - Design (e.g., blinding, active or passive controls)
  - Measurements (e.g., reliability, internal and external validity, construct validity)
  - Analysis procedures (e.g., validity of statistical procedures)

Any Questions?

## Requirements for the Presentation

- Build groups based on what makes sense for systematization, e.g.,
  - common boundary condition (e.g., person, situation, time, role of autonomy)
  - common (media) use case (e.g., mHealth, GDPR, ...)
- Always return to the following two questions:
  - What constitutes autonomy in digital communication (how does you perspective contribute to that?)
  - How does this relate to individuals' autonomy need experiences as defined in SDT?
  
***

### Remember the research questions
  
- **RQ1**: What are the *mechanisms* that are proposed to connect digital media use and autonomy need experiences?
- (**RQ2**: Which *research perspectives* can be identified in the study of digital autonomy?)
- **RQ3**: What are the *theoretical approaches* that are used by these perspectives and how do they relate to each other?
- **RQ4**: Which of these perspectives focus on *individual perceptions* of digital autonomy or *autonomy need experiences* that relate to digital media use?
- **RQ5**: How are individual perceptions of digital autonomy or autonomy need experiences that relate to digital media use *studied empirically*?

***

### Formal Structure

- Groups:
  - Digital Healthcare (max 3)
  - Digital Media Use (max 3)
  - Digital Pedagogy (1)
  - Digital Power Structures (1)
- Can be split again for term paper
- Length of 5-7 minutes (prepare no more than 5 slides!)
- Focus on theory integration and synthesis in your presentation
- Always return to the following two questions:
  - What constitutes autonomy in digital communication (how does you perspective contribute to that?)
  - How does this relate to individuals' autonomy need experiences as defined in SDT?

:::fragment

- Group presentation is a work-in-progress!
- Will not be graded!
- You will give and receive feedback
- Will be the basis for your term paper
