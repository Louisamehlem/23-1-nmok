Writing narrative literature reviews. *Review of General Psychology, 1*(3), 311–320. https://doi.org/10.1037/1089-2680.1.3.311\n:::\n\n***\n\n### Theoretical Integration\n\n- Do not only describe the procedures and observations of various studies but relate them to the theoretical issues\n- **Synthesis**: a summary of individual study findings which juxtaposes them, often to identify patterns and provide a basis for (further) integration\n- **Analysis**: methods that critically assess the synthesized evidence, try to explore/explain heterogeneity, and ultimately answer the RQs\n\n***\n\n### Critical Appraisal\n\n- Do not critique individual studies, but groups of studies\n- Composite quality scoring (CQS): Uses a pre-validated quality appraisal sheet that captures a composite index of overall study quality (rather uncommon)\n- Assessment of best practice:\n  - Sampling (e.g., selection, assignment to conditions)\n  - Design (e.g., blinding, active or passive controls)\n  - Measurements (e.g., reliability, internal and external validity, construct validity)\n  - Analysis procedures (e.g., validity of statistical procedures)\n  \n***\n\n:::big-text\nAny Questions?\n:::\n\n***\n\n## Requirements for the Presentation\n\n- Build groups based on what makes sense for systematization, e.g.,\n  - common boundary condition (e.g., person, situation, time, role of autonomy)\n  - common (media) use case (e.g., mHealth, GDPR, ...)\n- Always return to the following two questions:\n  - What constitutes autonomy in digital communication (how does you perspective contribute to that?)\n  - How does this relate to individuals' autonomy need experiences as defined in SDT?\n  \n***\n\n### Remember the research questions\n  \n- **RQ1**: What are the *mechanisms* that are proposed to connect digital media use and autonomy need experiences?\n- (**RQ2**: Which *research perspectives* can be identified in the study of digital autonomy?)\n- **RQ3**: What are the *theoretical approaches* that are used by these perspectives and how do they relate to each other?\n- **RQ4**: Which of these perspectives focus on *individual perceptions* of digital autonomy or *autonomy need experiences* that relate to digital media use?\n- **RQ5**: How are individual perceptions of digital autonomy or autonomy need experiences that relate to digital media use *studied empirically*?\n\n***\n\n### Formal Structure\n\n- Groups:\n  - Digital Healthcare (max 3)\n  - Digital Media Use (max 3)\n  - Digital Pedagogy (1)\n  - Digital Power Structures (1)\n- Can be split again for term paper\n- Length of 5-7 minutes (prepare no more than 5 slides!)\n- Focus on theory integration and synthesis in your presentation\n- Always return to the following two questions:\n  - What constitutes autonomy in digital communication (how does you perspective contribute to that?)\n  - How does this relate to individuals' autonomy need experiences as defined in SDT?\n\n:::fragment\n\n- Group presentation is a work-in-progress!\n- Will not be graded!\n- You will give and receive feedback\n- Will be the basis for your term paper\n\n:::\n\n***\n\n:::big-text\nAny Questions?\n:::\n\n# References\n\n",
